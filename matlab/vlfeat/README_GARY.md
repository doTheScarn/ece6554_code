# Quick notes:

This repository contains only my modifications or additions to the VLFeat Matlab Code.

#Installation
When you install VLFeat, don't just clone the Git repo, because it doesn't have the toolbox and you'd need to compile the binaries yourself. Find the right option on the VLFeat website that has the toolboxes.

#Setup each time
Every time you open Matlab, you need to run:
run vl_setup
